# About KeyFinder:

KeyFinder is a tool for estimating the musical key of digital recordings, to
aid DJs in harmonic mixing. It's primarily developed as Mac software but I
try to maintain compatibility with Windows. Some users have reported success
in building for Linux.

KeyFinder began as Ibrahim Sha'ath's final project submission during an MSc in Computer Science
at Birkbeck, University of London. His project report, which documents its
algorithms in detail, is available along with a binary download for MacOS at
www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder

Localisations are hosted at https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/is_keyfinder/
